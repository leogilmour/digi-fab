              Even though it ºs not my final project, iterating on my kinetic
              sculpture is a great framework for learning new skills. On
              reviewing my jewellery carousel prototype I wanted to create a
              bespoke fitting for the jewellery to replace the bulldog clips.
              This was not something I was able to do (obviously) in 2D parts.
              For extra jshzsh I designed a star-shaped hook. This allows
              earrings to sit in the lower star points but also little arms to
              support a necklace.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              There is a loop (not visible in picture) which is the diameter to
              fit the screw sitting under the gear above the carousel roof.

            <p>This version was a small disaster üòÇ.</p>
            <br />
            <p>
              In an attempt to optimise the structural integrity of the hook, I
              chose a complex print orientation. This is because the Prusa
              Slicer prints 2D layers which fuse together. The fusing together
              of the layers is not as strong as the strength within the layer
              itself.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Prusa added a lot of organic supports to make my proposed print
              orientation to work.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              It was impossible to remove them and unsurprisingly the hook
              broke... between slices where these prints are weakest.

              I increased the thickness by 1mm and I removed all the curvature
              which probably made the hook more fiddly than it needed to be (and
              possibly weaker). I also changed the design a little.

              Thinking about different printer layouts, I decided to go for the
              green one that would reduce organic supports while, hopefully,
              still optimising for the expected force directions. There is a
              weakness between the loop around the screw and the arm holding the
              star which is fairly critical. We will have to see what happens.

              Screwing the screw into the star hook was quite difficult and I
              was a little concerned about the PLA slices holding but since I
              want the hook to rotate with the screw it ºs good it ºs a tight fit.
              If the screw rotates within the hook, it ºs a fail. This being
              said, I am surprised I didn ºt accommodate a kerf-like parameter
              into my design, e.g. screwDiam + kerf, to take the additive
              tolerance into consideration. I restarted my design at some point
              so perhaps I dropped the param.
              <br />
              (I can ºt use a hexagon shaped hole because that ºs reserved for the
              gear above which will rotate the hexagon nut.)
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              I think varying the length of the star stem would be visually good
              and practically smart for different sized earrings.

              I scanned a tiny hedgehog shaped planter. This was not an ideal

              I will get to test my star hook properly once I have finished

              The 3D printed items are definitely fragile between slices and
              cutting away (organic) scaffolding needs to take this into
              consideration. I want to take the ‚Äúkerf‚Äù into consideration next
              time.

              I might inadvertently alter any project plans to ensure they don ºt
              require 3D scanning of any sort!

            <p>
              As part of my refining the carousel, I have been designing 2D
              pieces that can slot together to create the base.

            <br />
            <p>
              Aside from being a neater design, it also won ºt require glue,
              allowing me to disassemble and reassemble the carousel.

            <br />

              I think the spacing is a little tight so I might decrease the kerf
              parameter. I also want to round the corners of sliding pieces for
              easier assembly. I need to create space for the external gear from
              the base above.
