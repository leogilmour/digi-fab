      <div className="m-auto max-w-xl">
        <h4 className="my-8 text-xl">Idea One: A fried egg machine 🎡</h4>
        <p>
          The machine would select an egg from a revolving holder of a
          half-dozen, and crack it into ... a hot pan? Could it add the oil
          beforehand? Some method of timing would switch it off? This is an
          attempt to make the Chitty Chitty Bang Bang machine feasible in scale.
          This is probably my preferred idea... 🍳
        </p>
        <h4 className="my-8 text-xl">
          Idea Two: A suitcase that turns into a wardrobe 🧳
        </h4>
        <p>
          A whole suitcase is probably too ambitious... the smaller version
          could be a jewellery case that turns into some kind of display? Like
          popping up into a revolving display case. Ok... this is quite extra. I
          grew up watching Clueless 💅.
        </p>
        <h4 className="my-8 text-xl">
          Idea Three: A toy that runs away from my dog barking 🐕
        </h4>
        <p>
          A small toy, like a robot from robot wars, that would have sound
          sensors and run in the opposite direction from any noise. It would be
          shaped so that she could not pick it up with her mouth because... she
          is quick to destroy things. So perhaps inspired by some defensive bugs
          🐞.

        POST-CLASS IDEA
      </h3>
      <div className="m-auto max-w-xl">
        <h4 className="my-8 text-xl">
          Final Idea: An alarm clock that wakes you with a cup of tea ☕️
        </h4>
        <p>
          This is inspired by the 60s / 70s miracle machines: “Teasmades” (which
          for some unknown reason faded in popularity). What could be better
          than being woken up with a cup of tea in bed?
        </p>
        <p>
          Basic features are an alarm clock which schedules the boiling water,
          but some even include lights. It would be fun to improve this variant
          with a SAD light that slowly turned on in advance of the cup of tea.
          Also, the option to sync with Amazon Alexa alarms or mobile phone
          alarms. There are many teasmade{" "}
          <a href="https://www.teasmade.uk/">fanatics</a> and they often have
          milk in a tiny thermos flask. It would be cool if a little robot arm
          opened the flask and poured in the milk too 🥛🐄.
